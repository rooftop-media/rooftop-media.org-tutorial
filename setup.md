# Set up for the rooftop-media.org tutorial

The website's functionality is mostly built with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. 
A basic understanding of those languages is probably required for this tutorial.

To follow this tutorial, you'll also need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on a computer.  
NodeJS lets you use Javascript outside of the web browser, to interact with our computer's files and text terminal, instead of browser pages.

NodeJS has some [nice documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/).  
This code follows a NodeJS [style guide](https://github.com/felixge/node-style-guide) created by Felix Geisendörfer.  
 - Rules include:
   - Always use single quotes for strings.
   - Limit functions to 15-20 lines of code.
