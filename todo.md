## Dev notes

<!--This project will take a lot of patience and careful planning...-->

Version 1.0 is pretty good, because the most time has been spent on it.  
The website's landing page needs to be modernized and more subtle.

The second version, "file editing", is off to a good start.  
 - The UI design for part A doesn't need to be 100% finished. It lays the groundwork for future UI design, and can eventually be updated.
 - The next thing that needs solved is _file storage_ and _file metadata storage_. This will require some research and decision making.
