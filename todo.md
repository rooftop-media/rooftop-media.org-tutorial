## Dev notes

<!--This project will take a lot of patience and careful planning...-->

Version 1.0 is pretty good, because the most time has been spent on it.  
The website's landing page needs to be modernized and more subtle.

The second version, "file editing", is off to a good start.  
 - The UI design for part A doesn't need to be 100% finished. It lays the groundwork for future UI design, and can eventually be updated.
 - The next thing that needs solved is _file storage_ and _file metadata storage_. This will require some research and decision making.

It would really make sense to start using external libraries with reliable dependencies!  
One example would be JQuery, which has 0 dependencies.

There's a library called [OS.js](https://www.os-js.org/).  
It would be neat to dive in to that kind of layout earlier.  This could also possibly be another library

Related to that topic, it would be useful to develop an HTML template system, like React or Vue, or maybe Ejs.  
This has obviously been something of interest for a while.
