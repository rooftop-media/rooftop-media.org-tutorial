v1 part B:
 - [ ] test database.js functions
 - [ ] in database.js, make table.insert check for uniqueness, have a standard error
 - [ ] use table.find to get all user rows, in `register` ?
 - [ ] explain salting and hashing passwords in a separate step? Or provide link?
 - [ ] allow no email and no phone on registration (allow duplicate "blank" number, email)
 - [ ] "ENTER" key to submit register and login forms
 - [ ] Ensure phone number input works even when the cursor is moved...

v1 part C I think
 - [ ] Make "user profile" and "logout" buttons a section with a toggleable display, instead of new code

v1 part D:
 - [ ] "Delete account" button in user settings

v1 part A thru F:
 - [ ] Change design to dark mode by default
